Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    It is nice to be able to categorize and seperate functions of my code into different classes. It is a lot easier to visualize how different parts of the code work together through encapsulation. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Worked:
        - follow directions
        - helper methods
        - testing all weird cases

    Didn't:
        - Not testing enough -> not knowing where the error was in all the classes/files

    Advice:
     - Dont be afraid to simplify your code with more methods
     - Test every method/class after writing it instead of waiting until the end because then you won't know what is causing your error
